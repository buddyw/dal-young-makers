[Dallas Young Makers Club](http://dallasyoungmakers.org/)


##Checklist

1. Go through the parts list and make sure that you have all of the necessary pieces to build your robot.

2. Follow the steps in the guide and assemble your robot.

3. Once everything is connected, turn on your robot with the `On-Off` button.

4. Press `Prgm` until the number '4' appears to the far right.

5. Hold the robot so that its tracks can spin freely and press the red `Run` button.

6. Make sure that the tracks are both turning the right way to make the robot move forward.

7. If the left or the right track is spinning the wrong direction:
   1. press the `Run` button again to stop the robot.
   2. Unplug the motor's cable from the top of the brick
   3. Rotate the plug and plug it back in
   4. Press `Run` again to re-test the track.

8. You can press `Prgm` to switch between different programs and press `Run` to start and stop each one.

9. Congratulations! Your robot is complete!


##Programs

Below is a list of programs loaded into your robot:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| `Prgm` # | Description                                              |

##Programming

All of the robot's programs are written in "Not Quite C" (called NQC for short).  This is a free and open source language and tool you can use to program these Lego RCX bricks. NQC is very similar to C.  C and C-like languages are very common and are used to program everything from robots and microwave ovens to desktop PCs and iPhone apps.

Open Source means that the computer instructions that make tools and robots work are available for everyone.  This makes it much easier for us to fix problems and understand and use tools to their fullest potential.

You can learn more about NQC programming at the [Bricxcc SourceForge Page](http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nqc/).

You can view the source code for your robot's programs on this class's [github repository](https://github.com/buddyw/dal-young-makers/tree/master/classes/build-a-rover).
