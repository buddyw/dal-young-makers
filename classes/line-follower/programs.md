## Programming

All of the robot's programs are written in "Not Quite C" (called NQC for short).  This is a free and open source language and tool you can use to program these Lego RCX bricks. NQC is very similar to C.  C and C-like languages are very common and are used to program everything from robots and microwave ovens to desktop PCs and iPhone apps.

Open Source means that the computer instructions that make tools and robots work are available for everyone.  This makes it much easier for us to fix problems and understand and use tools to their fullest potential.

You can learn more about NQC programming at the [Bricxcc SourceForge Page](http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nqc/).

You can view the source code for your robot's programs on this class's [github repository](https://github.com/buddyw/dal-young-makers/tree/master/classes/build-a-rover).
