## Installation

The steps below allow you to flash RCX on any Debian based linux machine.

1. Install prerequisite packages: `sudo apt-get install git nqc dialog unzip wget`
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/buddyw/dal-young-makers.git`
3. Run `./dal-young-makers/tools/flash-menu` to start flashing RCX bricks

You will need internet connectivity the first time you flash a class as the correct RCX firmware package will be automatically downloaded and stored in a `tmp` folder. After it has been downloaded, no internet access is necessary to flash that class.
